Welcome to SWIFT Emulator's Documentation
=========================================

The SWIFT-Emulator is a python toolkit for using Gaussian
process machine learning to analyse and produce outputs 
from the hydro code SWIFT that processed by VELOCIraptor 
and the swift-pipeline.

By combining a selection of SWIFT-io and GP analysis 
tools, the SWIFT-Emulator serves to make emulation of 
SWIFT outputs very easy, while staying flexible enough 
to emulate anything, given a good set of training data.
