======================

The SWIFT-Emulator is designed to easily generate
:mod:`SWIFT` parameter files, and read
:mod:`swift-pipeline` outputs. Here you can find
a description of how to use the `SWIFT-Emulator`'s
tools to set up an experimental design, and then
load the resulting scaling relations.
